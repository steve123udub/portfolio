/*Quotes from https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/comprehensive-guide-when-to-use-em-vs-rem--cms-23984
 For this reason the primary purpose of using rem units should be to ensure that whatever default font size a user has their browser set to, the layout will adjust to accommodate the size of text within it.
 For this reason, the primary purpose of em units should be to allow for scalability within the context of a specific design element
 For this reason, I recommend only using em units if you identify a clear need for them.*/
